# Introduction
Ubuntu commands are useful in our day-to- day life. Some commands are required more than usual.
sudo apt-get update is one of them.

Here I present you method to create alias / keyword for your command.

You can create a command 'up'  i.e. just by delivering command 'up' in terminal your system will run sudo apt-get update or any command that you wish.

## Important

- Command should be valid.

- Keyword should not pre-exist.
	- reboot is a command, hence it can't be over-written.



# Instruction
	git clone https://github.com/SarCode/Ubuntu-Software
	cd Ubuntu-Software/Custom-Keywords
	python3 alias.py

# Try using your new commands now !!
