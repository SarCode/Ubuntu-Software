# Introduction

All of us have at-least once accidentally closed a terminal which has our command running, and then we have re-iniliase the whole setup.

Well I give you a life-long solution to it.

`nohup` command


## Usage
Example:

`nohup sudo apt-get upgrade`

Now, even if I close the terminal, the command won't stop and will work on the background.

Nice ! 

You can use it to run software via terminal and then close the terminal.

Example:
`nohup spyder`

I personally use nohup command a lott.
Just simply, run a command and close the tab.
